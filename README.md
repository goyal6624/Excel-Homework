# Excel-Homework
Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Solution
Conditional formatting was implimented to fill in each cell in the "state" and "Percent Funded" column with different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live. The "Percent Funded" also is newly created to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.

Conditional Formating

Another column I called "Average Donation" was created that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

Two new columns, one called "Category" at S and another called "Sub-Category" at T, which uses formulas to split the "Category and Sub-Category" column into two-part was created.

A pivotal table was analyzed, and implemented to see the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category. In addition to that, a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table has been created.
